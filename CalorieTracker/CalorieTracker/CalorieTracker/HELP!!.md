#  HELP PLS: 

## Favorites
    Everything is broken :( I just want to be able to add favorites from the AddView
    
    REMIND Dr. J that we are pulling it out because of the conflict with the "add" button
    
    LEAVE the actual code
    
## Background
    I want to be able to have the text boxes look like they are on a square
    
    Also, this would be helpful to be able to use the gradient but then have the title area be white
    
## charts
    


~~ Search
    would like to search foods by name but can't not sure how to implement
        ~have tried to do it in FoodList instead but search bar not showing up
        and app keeps crashing (possibly because asking to do 2 actions in 1 button)
